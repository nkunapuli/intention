Intention - Your Digital Focus Companion

## Overview

Intention is a Chrome extension designed to help you maintain focus and intentionality in your digital life. In a world where our attention is constantly pulled in multiple directions, Intention serves as your digital accountability partner, ensuring that your online activities align with your goals.

## Features

* Intention setting: Every time you open a new Chrome window or click on the Intention icon in the toolbar, Intention prompts you to set your purpose for the browsing session.
* Real-time alignment check: Utilizes gpt-4o-mini to evaluate if your current browsing aligns with your stated intention.
* Gentle reminders: Displays non-intrusive warnings when your browsing diverges from your intention, allowing you to make conscious decisions about your online activities.

## How It Works

* Set your intention: When you open a new Chrome window or click on the extension icon in the toolbar, you'll be prompted to state your intention for the browsing session.
* Browse normally: Go about your online activities as you normally would.
* AI-powered checks: In the background, Intention uses gpt-4o-mini to analyze each URL you visit, comparing it against your stated intention.
* Stay on track: If a misalignment is detected, a warning appears to remind you of your original intention.

## Why Intention?

* Increase productivity by staying focused on your tasks
* Reduce time wasted on unintended browsing
* Cultivate a more intentional and mindful approach to internet use
* Achieve a better work-life balance by aligning your online time with your goals
