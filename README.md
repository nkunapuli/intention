Intention - Your Digital Focus Companion

## Overview

Intention is a Chrome extension designed to help you maintain focus and intentionality in your digital life. In a world where our attention is constantly pulled in multiple directions, Intention serves as your digital accountability partner, ensuring that your online activities align with your goals.

## Features

* Intention Setting: Every time you open a new Chrome window, Intention prompts you to set your purpose for the browsing session.
* Real-time Alignment Check: Utilizes GPT-4 to evaluate if your current browsing aligns with your stated intention.
* Gentle Reminders: Displays non-intrusive warnings when your browsing diverges from your intention, allowing you to make conscious decisions about your online activities.
* Customizable: Set your own API key for personalized use.

## How It Works

* Set Your Intention: When you open a new Chrome window, you'll be prompted to state your intention for the browsing session.
* Browse Normally: Go about your online activities as you normally would.
* AI-Powered Checks: In the background, Intention uses GPT-4o to analyze each URL you visit, comparing it against your stated intention.
* Stay on Track: If a misalignment is detected, a warning banner appears at the top of your browser, reminding you of your original intention.
