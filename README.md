A Chrome extension which keeps your browsing sessions intentional.

##Mission

When browsing the internet, our attention is hijacked in every direction. Whatever intention we had when opening the browser is quickly lost in a barrage of content and ads selected by algorithms to be maximally distracting. For those of us who spend the majority of our time in the digital world, this is deeply silly. It is like going to work in an active battlefield and a red light district all in one.

In spite of how we like to think about ourselves, our brains are too feeble and distractible to withstand the barrage of the internet alone. This is why you need a trusted friend, a partner who will look out for you and gently remind you to stay on task.

##Intention

When opening a Chrome window, the extension will prompt you by asking, "What is your intention for this browsing session?" Whether it is to study for an exam, write code, or destress and watch videos, Intention will make sure you stick to it.

It does this by sending each URL you visit to GPT-4o along with your stated intention and asks if your browsing is in alignment with your intention. If the answer is no, then an alert will trigger that will inform you that this website might not be in alignment with your intention. You can either choose to follow or ignore the alert's advice, but at least you can now be conscious about it.
