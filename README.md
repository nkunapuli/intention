Intention

## Overview

Intention is a Chrome extension designed to help you maintain focus and intentionality when browsing the Internet. In a world where our willpower is weak and attention is under assult, Intention serves as a digital accountability partner, ensuring that your online activities align with your goals.

## How It Works

* Set your intention: When you open a new Chrome window or click on the Intention icon in the toolbar, you'll be prompted to declare your intention for the browsing session.
* Browse normally: Go about your online activities as you normally would.
* AI-powered checks: In the background, Intention uses gpt-4o to analyze each website you visit, comparing it against your stated intention.
* Stay on track: If a misalignment is detected, a warning appears to remind you of your original intention.

## Installation

1. Clone this repository or download the ZIP file
2. Open Chrome and navigate to chrome://extensions/
